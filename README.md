# Unsupervised-Graphs-Cluster

---
### Introduction
In the report, we used one pipeline to deal with the unsupervised graph clustering method.


I evaluate this model on the challenging problems of graphs clustering that play an important role in the classification of molecules in chemical compounds systems. 

The experimental analysis demonstrates that this model is not only able to deal with the labeled datasets but it can also give an reasonable clustering result on the unlabelled dataset.
