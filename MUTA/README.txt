=======  DATA SET ======= 

Each of the data sets available on this repository is divided into three disjoint subsets, which can be used for training, validation, and testing novel learning algorithms (train.cxl, valid.cxl, test.cxl). Mutagenicity is one of the numerous adverse properties of a compound that hampers its potential to become a marketable drug [kazius04derivation]. The molecules are converted into graphs in a straightforward manner by representing atoms as nodes and the covalent bonds as edges. Nodes are labeled with the number of the corresponding chemical symbol and edges by the valence of the linkage. The data set was originally prepared by the authors of [kazius04derivation]. The mutagenicity data set is divided into two classes mutagen and nonmutagen. We use a training set of size 1,500, a validation set of size 500, and a test set of size 2,337. Thus, there are 4,337 elements totally (2,401 mutagen elements and 1,936 nonmutagen elements). The classification rate achieved on this data set is 71.5%.
